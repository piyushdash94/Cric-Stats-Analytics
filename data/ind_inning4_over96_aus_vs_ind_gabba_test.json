To repeat the words of Tony Greig from 20 years ago, India have won the Test match, India have won the series, and this series has been as much of a fairytale as that one. Let me describe briefly. There was no mid-off, just a straight extra-cover, and Pant brought his wrists into play to drive that full one to the left of the fielder. He kept running, Saini kept running, and I guess no one realised there was no fielder near the ball until it dribbled past the rope\n"
